<p>In "We Need To Fix Black Hair in Video Games" Kinda Funny, Blessing Adeoye Jr breaks down the history and representation of black hair in video games, and what it means for representation.</p>
<p>The main criticism is that video games just don't have much black hair representation. Typically, black hair in games comes in two forms: afros, and cornrows. These are decent choices, but not enough representation. Based on that representation, you'd expect half the black population to have cornrows, but that just isn't the case. </p>
<p>In the past, video games have been very limited on what they can do graphically. Nowadays though, updated tech means devs have no excuse to not implement better examples of black hair. Previously, they either had to go super minimal (which explains the cornrows/afros, as they're relatively simple hairstyles that are visually distinct), or go all into it and make it a focus (in a character focused game, for example). Now, the difficulty for dev teams comes from getting correct representation, rather than any technical details.</p>
<p>As someone who isn't particularly interested in recreating myself via character customizations (though admittedly, I'm in the privileged position where the possibility, if I wanted to create myself, is nearly always present), it's clear to me that some people DO care an awful lot about being able to recreate themselves in games. Even when someone doesn't like to recreate themselves, having that representation is important to feeling included and represented. Black people make up a significant portion of video game audiences, and they deserve significant representation.</p>
<p>When Rockstar Games added a black hairstyle to GTA 5, it wasn't a huge update. It was a single hairstyle, but the impact it had on the black audience was much bigger, due to it finally being good representation.</p>
<p>I did want to address a point that Blessing made about game developers. At one point early on, he sarcastically stated that making monsters is easier than making black hair, implying the former is more difficult, and that teams capable of the former are surely capable of the latter as well. From a technical perspective, I agree that black hair is absoultely easier. But in general, I think making monsterous crows, dragons, and giant hands IS easier than implementing black hair. This is because crows, dragons, and giant hands do not have a culture to respect, so the dev team does not need to respect real-world crows, dragons, or hands. Because they're fictional creatures, dev teams don't need to worry about inaccurately portraying them, which is not the case with black hair. Naturally, this means that dev teams need more experience with different cultures in order to accurately portray them.</p>
<p>Going forward, video games have been making great strides in representation. Horizon Forbidden West has some great examples of black hair, Street Fighter 6 has a character whose visually defined by her accurate hair, and Miles Morales in the Spider Man: Miles Morales has a 10/10 representation of black hair. <strong> However, even with all these great examples, game developers need to do more to accurately represent black people, by paying attention to small details and getting them right.</strong></p>
